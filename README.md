## 1. A Little About LangGraph

LangGraph = *“A directed graph where nodes mutate shared state, and edges depend on that state.”*

### Core Mental Model (Burn This In)

* Every LangGraph project answers four questions:
* What is my state?
* Which nodes modify which parts of the state?
* Which decisions depend on the state?
* When does the graph stop?
